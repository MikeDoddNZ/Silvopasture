APSIM simulations of part nelder designs using STRUM and AgPasture
Agpasture silvo is a pasture simulation with the intent of artificially modifying weather file to simulate trees
Agpasture silvo  expt was to modify understory species at two sites
Agpasture Ball nelder is an experiment with open pasture and two tree densities
STRUM Ball nelder is basic poplar=pasture setup but has a mass balance issue with AGPRyegrass when enabling Row zone
